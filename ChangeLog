0.8.5 (beta 1)
	- Fixed zone expiration. Defined value was not honored while generating
	  configurations. While on the matter, added also zone expiration to
	  show in zone listing. Pink denotes already expired zone, pale yellow
	  warns upcoming expiration from SAURON_REMOVE_EXPIRED_DELAY config
	  value and pale green lines when expiration value has been defined.
	  Also zone link tooltip can be used to check quicky from the list
	  expiration status. [mesrik]
	- In Host search the last drop-down list has a new item "Has MX". With
	  it you can find hosts which have MX templates. Note that while all
	  other items in the drop-down list require a pattern, this one doesn't
	  (though you can use one); without a patterm it's enough that a host
	  has an MX template, the name of the template doesn't matter, hence the
	  title "Has MX" instead of just "MX".
	- In export-hosts search by subgroups and by MAC addresses have been
	  added. [TVu]
	- In modhosts, when --commit is given on command line, interactive
	  cofirmation is no longer asked. [TVu]
	- In Hosts button "Alias" was not displayed properly according to
	  privileges. Fixed. [TVu]
	- In Hosts, "Group" has been renamed "Base group". A DHCP client class
	  can no longer be added to a host as the base group, but it can still
	  be added as a subgroup. This is because they don't work as a base
	  group, but the reason for this turned out to be elusive. [TVu]
	- Description and comment fields of VLANs now accept up to 200
	  characters. [TVu]
	- In Login, plugin "Edit users & groups" is now available if you have
	  sufficient authorization level. Currently the name is just a future
	  hope; actually you can list all users known to Sauron, and see some
	  basic information about them, and by clicking a user's login name you
	  will see the same information that you could previusly see only for
	  your own account. This has been expanded to show where user privileges
	  come from, either given to the user individually (bad idea!) or given
	  to user groups. Some rare privileges are now shown if the user has
	  them. [TVu]
	- In Nets / Show Hosts the number of hosts shown on one page is now
	  unlimited. [TVu]
	- Only superusers are allowed to add, edit, delete or copy Delegations
	  and Glue records. [TVu]
	- In Hosts TTL can now be edited by a non-superuser only if the user has
	  TTL flag set (with modgroup or moduser). The program has default
	  limits for the value (600 / 86400); different limits can be set in
	  config file. Superuser can set values outside limits, in which case a
	  non-superuser can't change the value.
	- If you select "Show Hosts" when viewing a subnet, glue records will be
	  shown in addition to hosts and host reservations. [TVu]

0.8.4 (beta 1)

	- Handling of SRV flag has been improved in the same way as AREC, CNAME
	  and SCNAME flags. All of these flags are used to give user privilege
	  to handle an object type if user has RW privilege to the zone, but not
	  RWX privilege. NOT COMPLETELY TESTED YET [TVu]
	- Hosts can now be searched based on their TXT records (regex search).
	  Details are explained in a tooltip attached to the title of the field.
	  [TVu]
	- You can now add TXT fields to AREC aliases. [TVu]
	- Password fields in Sauron login and Login.pm are now 40 characters
	  wide. Spaces can be used in passphrases. [TVu]

0.8.3 (beta 1)

	- Fixed: Hosts.pm gave sometimes an unnecessary error message related to
	  user rights (SRV flag). [TVu]
	- In multiline fields of Hosts.pm comment column is now uniformly 20
	  characters wide, with maximum text length of 80 characters. [TVu]
	- Flags AREC, CNAME and SCNAME, which you can set or clear with mod-
	  group/moduser, affected only creation of these aliases. Now they also
	  affect editing and deleting - but not viewing - as they should. [TVu]
	- $SAURON_DNSNAME_CHECK_MODE in config has been replaced by $SAURON_
	  DNSNAME_CHECK_LEVEL, which specifies the authorization level needed to
	  use underscore "_" in domain names. Default = 999 = superuser. [TVu]
	- Both on Login page and in status command line script users' idle time
	  is now shown as hh:mm:ss. [TVu]
	- You can now temporarily allow use of Sauron web interface to super-
	  users only. For details see $SAURON_TEMP_LOCK in config file. [TVu]
	- There is a new way to add Custom Zone File Entries: Instead of single
	  separate lines you can create multiple textareas, one for each entity.
	  There is no separate Comment column; use comment lines ";". Textareas
	  can be resized in modern browsers, but size is reset if the page is
	  reloaded (e.g. when you open a new textarea). Note that long lines are
	  wrapped, not scrolled, but this doesn't add hard line breaks into the
	  text; the program checks that lines are not too long. Both new and old
	  style entries will appear in configuration files (new first), but you
	  should plan to migrate all old entries into textareas, so that old
	  style entries can eventually be removed from Sauron. [TVu]
	- Local DHCP settings have been added to Servers form. These are useful
	  if e.g. you want to create DHCP clusters. Local settings are available
	  both for primary and secondary servers, whereas global settings
	  naturally are for primary servers only. Local settings will appear in
	  dhcpd.conf before global settings. [TVu]
	- DHCPv2 is no longer supported when generating configuratios (script
	  "sauron"). [TVu]
	- If you are a superuser, you can use a single dot as the target name
	  in Hosts / SRV records / SRV entries. This feature existed in an
	  earlier version of Sauron, but has later disappeared. Restored. [TVu]
	- You can now create CNAME and Static alias names of the form *.domain
	  [TVu]
	- You can now add TXT fields to MX records. [TVu]
	- Several host name fields on several forms have been changed to allow
	  names up to 253 characters long, but note that the length of the name
	  of the currently selected zone is subtracted from this limit (i.e.
	  the name you give must be that much shorter), unless you give an
	  FQDN. [TVu]
	- modhosts: New options --addsubgroup and --rmsubgroup can be used to
	  add hosts to a subgroup and to remove them from a subgroup. You can
	  use both at the same time to move hosts from one subgroup to another.
	  [TVu]
	- Fixed: Dates on host search form had no effect on static and CNAME
	  alias search results. [TVu]
	- Bugfix: Fixed again dhcpd.conf pool entries not generated
	  when hosts are expired or reserved. This was already fixed 2009-03-01
	  by me, but came somehow back,	so it needed fixing again [mesrik]
	- Bugfix: Reverse zones are now created correctly for IPv4s where
	  the last field is 0. [TVu]
	- zone defined ttl patch apply fix [mesrik]
	- modhosts clarified and cleaned up help, added --setfield, --hinfo
	  and --type=dhcponly [mesrik]
	- Username (login name) can now be changed with moduser. [TVu]
	- TTL is now copied from host to alias when you create a CNAME or AREC
	  alias (even if you don't have permission to change the value). [TVu]
	- While subnets and virtual nets need ranges, Sauron created ranges for
	  nets as well, which raised an error when changing net CIDR in certain
	  ways. Fixed. [TVu]
	- OIDs (Object IDentifiers) are no longer used in the database. [TVu]
	- User's default server, or both server and zone, can now be set with
	  adduser. These can also be changed with moduser. See --help in each
	  script. [TVu]
	- All references to Net::Netmask have been removed. This old library
	  doesn't support IPv6, but it was still used in a few places, including
	  some where it didn't work. {TVu]
	- In 'Nets' a new selection, '+ Free', is available to superusers and to
	  users with authorization level at least as high as specified in config
	  with variable $ALEVEL_SHOW_UNALLOCATED_CIDRS. This selection shows the
	  largest possible CIDRs, that are part of a net, but not of a subnet.
	  For IPv6 nets the results may seem surprising. Note that unallocated
	  areas may overlap virtual nets. PL/pgsql language and three functions
	  have been added to Sauron database for this feature. [TVu]
	- In addgroup you can now copy privileges from an existing user group
	  with --priv. [TVu]
	- In modgroup (moduser) you can now change the name and comment of a
	  group, see the script's --help. [TVu]
	- expire-hosts has been completely rewritten because the old version had
	  multiple complex bugs. See the script's --help for new and *changed*
	  options. [TVu]
	- Fixed two bugs, which generated (otherwise harmless) SQL errors in
	  logs. [TVu]
	- When viewing a host reservation, background color is now cyan. [TVu]
	- When a CNAME alias has been deleted, a button is now shown to navigate
	  to the host that the alias referred to. [TVu]
	- modhosts now handles correctly --setedate=0 [Riku Meskanen & TVu]
	- A new command line tool, dbcheck, has been added. It makes a number of
	  consistency checks on Sauron database and has its own help. New checks
	  will be added as needed.
	- deluser has been changed so that default is now to anonymize the user
	  instead of deletion. User records can still be deleted by specifying
	  --delete on the command line (*not* recommended). Only expired and/or
	  locked users can be anonymized or deleted.
	- User and User group history is now recorded each time when a user or
	  group is added or deleted, or a user is anonymized, and when a user
	  is added to a group or removed from one, or moved to another group.
	  History search finds both users and groups if you choose 'Users' from
	  the drop-down list, but they have different types (5 and 6) for future
	  use.
	- When showing list of nets in 'Nets', and hovering cursor on a VLAN
	  name, a tooltip will show the VLAN number, or that there is no number.
	  [TVu]
	- In moduser --list and modgroup --list=members,xyz column Superuser has
	  been replaced by column Flags, which indicates if the user is L
	  (Locked), E (Expired) and/or S (Superuser). In addition, the user's
	  authorization level is shown. Column widths and order have been
	  adjusted. [TVu]
	- Edit Net gave an error message (which could be bypassed by clicking
	  Apply again) when a virtual net was changed to a subnet. Fixed. [TVu]
	- In web interface extraneous whitespace is removed from all input
	  fields when data is saved. By default this means all whitespace, but
	  treatment of each field can be tailored individually. You can also
	  turn this feature on or off by setting or not setting configuration
	  file option $SAURON_REMOVE_WHITESPACE [TVu]
	- Host search now actually finds all types when you specify "Any type".
	  Also, CNAME and Static aliases are identified as such, not just
	  "Alias". [TVu]
	- Added deletion of AREC aliases when deleting a host, unless those
	  aliases also point to some other host. Deletion of references to AREC
	  aliases (arec_entries) was already in the code. Added also deletion of
	  static aliases that refer to the host being deleted. [TVu]

0.8.1 (beta 2)

	- Because of a change in PostgreSQL version db_encode_str() has been
	  changed so that if the string contains backslash characters (\), not
	  only will they be doubled as before, but the string will also be
	  prepended with an 'e'. Calls of this sub have been added to six source
	  files in places where it may be needed when using regular expressions,
	  but was previously missing. [TVu]
	  Example: In: db_encode_str('domain\.tld') Out: e'domain\\.tld'
	- Bugfix in hosts.pm (cname_alias). [TVu]
	- Columns named ipv6 have been removed from tables a_entries, leases,
	  nets and servers. These columns were never used. [TVu]
	- Host table info column has been altered from char(80) to text becasue
	  modhosts writes longer entries than other programs. [TVu]
	- You can now search hosts based on their hardware or software info
	  (HINFO). [TVu]
	- Bugfixes in Groups / Delete. Count of host records that use the group
	  now includes hosts for which the group has been defined as a subgroup.
	  Subgroup definitions are also updated or deleted according to your
	  choice when a group is deleted. Previously only groups were counted /
	  updated / deleted. Actually, any distinction between Group and Sub-
	  groups is purely historical. Properly, the current concept of Group
	  should be discarded and Subgroups should be renamed Groups. [TVu]

0.8.0 (beta)

	- For Host aliases, the "Alias for" field maxlen prperty has been
	  extended to 254 characters to accomodate aliases provided by Google.
	  [Riku Meskanen & TVu]
	- Zone comment field has been widenend from 60 to 80 characters, but
	  maximum text length has been increased to 200 characters. If the field
	  contains "http://" or "https://", anything from that to the end will
	  be turned into a link when the comment is shown. E.g. if you write
	  "Google: http://google.com", "Google: google.com" will be shown, and
	  that "google.com" will act as a link which opens a new tab / window.
	  Any parameters and/or fragment identifier will not be shown, but they
	  will remain part of the link. With this feature you can link to
	  extended comments in a Wiki or whatever. [TVu]
	- In "Select zone" limit of showing only the first 50 zones has been
	  removed. [TVu]
	- In Add zone and Edit zone you can give a cidr as reverse zone name;
	  Sauron will convert it to an arpa format zone name. E.g.
	  2001:bad:cafe::/48 -> e.f.a.c.d.a.b.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa - Also works
	  with IPv4. [TVu]
	- Expiration date has been added to zone display. This date affects
	  creation of named.conf, zone files, reverse maps and dhcpd.conf. The
	  date can e.g. be used to temporarily disable a zone by setting its
	  expiration into the past. [TVu]
	- Option --list="members,<groupname>" has been added to modgroup to
	  list all members of a user group. [TVu]
	- In moduser and modgroup privilege level 999 is now accepted as it
	  should (previously undocumented change). [TVu]
	- moduser and modgroup have a new option --add="defhost,<template>"
	  The template is used when the user adds or copies a host. The template
	  must include one variable, %{id}, which Sauron will replace with the
	  new host's id, e.g. h%{id}.exam -> h12045.exam - The template doesn't
	  work for superusers, but the variable can be used by anyone by typing
	  it as part of a new host's name. [TVu]
	- --disable and --enable have been added to modhosts. [TVu]
	- Field "Last lease issued by DHCP server" is now displayed also for
	  disabled hosts (host reservations). [TVu]
	- In Host / Copy Sauron now checks that the suggested new domain name is
	  not in use (previously undocumented). {TVu]
	- In Edit Net, when the net has auto address range, it now also has "IP
	  address assignment policy" with these options:
	  - "Lowest free" and "Highest free". These should be self-explanatory.
	    Between Range start and Range end, inclusive. "Lowest free" is the
	    default.
	  - "MAC based". IPv6 nets only. IPv6 addresses will combine the subnet
	    prefix and the MAC (Ethernet) address. When you add a host you must
	    give the MAC, otherwise Sauron will not be able to create the IP
	    address. Note! These are NOT the modified EUI-64 addresses that are
	    created by autoconfiguration.
	  - "IPv4 based". IPv6 nets only. IPv6 addresses will combine the subnet
	    prefix (max. 96 bits) and the host's existing IPv4 address. Thus,
	    this option is only useful when you are adding IPv6 addresses to old
	    hosts.
	  If you try to use "MAC based" when the host has no MAC address, or
	  "IPv4 based" when the host has no IPv4 address, Sauron will default to
	  "Lowest free". [TVu]
	- In Edit Host Sauron will try to show a new drop-down list next to IP
	  address / Add button. The list is based on the subnets (and any
	  included virtual nets) that share the same VLAN as the existing IP
	  addresses, suggesting one possible address from each net based on that
	  net's IP address assignment policy. Thus, if you create an IPv6
	  network structure that parallels your old IPv4 network, assigning the
	  IPv6 nets to the same VLANs as the IPv4 nets, you can add an IPv6
	  address to each host from this list. Select a net and leave the
	  address field empty, then press "Add". The same policies are used when
	  you add, move or copy a host; in the last two cases based on the
	  address that you selected at the top of the page before pressing
	  "Move" or "Copy" if the host has multiple IP addresses. When you copy
	  an IPv4 host, Sauron will suggest a new address as before, but based
	  on the net's policy (instead of "next free"). For an IPv6 host a
	  suggestion will only be shown if net's policy is "Lowest free" or
	  "Higest free"; otherwise an address will be created when you create
	  the host. Note also that "Ethernet address" has been changed to "MAC
	  address" on the forms. [TVu]
	- To the top of the host information form a new drop-down list has been
	  added for the host's IP addresses. Buttons "This Subnet", "Ping",
	  "Traceroute", "Copy" and "Move" now use the selected address instead
	  of only using the first one. "Network Settings" is not affected,
	  instead, it now shows settings for all addresses. (Previously "Move"
	  was not supported at all for hosts with multiple addresses.) [TVu]
	- IPv6 support added to display of Network Settings. Broadcast address
	  no longer shown for IPv6 nets. Mask (prefix) length added to Network
	  address. [Tvu]
	- "Download CSV" button has been added to Browse Nets. The CSV list can
	  be opened e.g. in a spreadsheet program. This feature is useful if you
	  have to create reports about IP address usage. [TVu]
	- In Browse Nets corrected indentation for IPv6 nets (function hex()
	  caused overflow). [TVu]
	- A new command line utility 'addipv6' has been added. With it you can add
	  IPv6 addresses to hosts in entire subnets or even larger parts of your
	  network with a single command. The utility includes its own
	  documentation - be sure to check --man first. [TVu]
	- update-dhcp-info can now handle change-of-year in the log file that it
	  reads, provided that there are no gaps longer than one year in the
	  file. The file can span multiple years. If you use a log file where
	  the *last* line is not from the current year, give the year of the
	  *last* line as parameter. The script also tries to update hosts with
	  dynamic addresses (changes untested). [TVu]
	- A new option, "Any zone", has been added to host search. By checking
	  this you can search hosts in all zones to which you have read access
	  (all zones if restrictions have not been turned on in configuration file
	  or if you are superuser). Current server only. Full domain names will be
	  shown in the list. Fully Qualified Domain Names are also shown when you
	  view or edit host information, just in case the search only found one
	  host, and the list is not shown. [TVu]
	- Search host now also finds hosts whose subgroup matches the selected
	  group. (A Czech-made limitation had to be removed in the way groups
	  are shown, because it was incompatible with the way groups are used in
	  the University of Jyvaskyla. More info in CGIutil.pm) [TVu]
	- When a list of hosts in a single net is shown, cidr, net name and
	  description of the net are displayed at top of page. [TVu]
	- Variable $ALEVEL can now be added to a plugin's configuration file to
	  define minimum authorization level required to use that plugin.
	  Default is 0. See 'sample.conf'. [TVu]
	- For sub and virtual nets, Net Info now shows net usage under (rather
	  than to the right of) the other data. For blocks with less than one
	  million addresses, the exact size is given; for larger blcoks only
	  appoximate size is shown, e.g. ~10^14. [TVu]
	- Colour coding has been reversed in Net Usage Map; green background now
	  indicates free addresses. [TVu]
	- Static aliases are displayed with the host whose aliases they are.
	  Types of aliases (CNAME, AREC, Static) are shown (previously only
	  AREC). When viewing a static alias for a host known by Sauron, host
	  name is a link to host information (previously only CNAME and AREC
	  aliases had links). [TVu]
	- In host browser, if the cidr of a single subnet was passed as
	  parameter, that cidr as well as the name and description of the net
	  are shown next to zone at top of page. [TVu]
	- In addition to the columns shown in Net browser, net usage in percents
	  is added as the last column of the csv file for IPv4 nets. This (and
	  more) is also shown as a tooltip when you move the mouse cursor over
	  the cidr of each net. This percentage can exceed 100 if more addresses
	  are used than there are "Usable addresses" as shown in Net Info. For
	  IPv6 nets tooltip shows the number of used addresses only; the column
	  in csv is empty. [TVu]
	- Zones can have multiple IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6). [TVu]
	- Record type in host search works now. [TVu]
	- In generatehosts handling of tags of the form :IPn: has been changed,
	  see the utility's help. Also, tags can now be uppercase or lowercase
	  and documentation has been added for tags :N2: to :N4: [TVu]
	- Login / Session info: If session ID (SID) is shown in input field,
	  buttons "Next SID" and "Previous SID" are also shown for easier
	  browsing of sessions. [TVu]
	- History search form has been added to login menu for users with
	  sufficient authorization level, which is specified in config file with
	  variable $ALEVEL_HISTORY_SEARCH. Default is superusers only. [The
	  method created for this purpose can be used to show/hide other menu
	  items based on auth level (previously this could only be done based on
	  superuser status). See Login.pm] Usernames are shown and links to
	  hosts and nets are created provided that those users, hosts and nets
	  still exist in the database. For a deleted host a link to that host's
	  history is created. Links are also created to sessions, except when
	  session id is -1. [TVu]
	- In host search, Entries per page has a new value, All, which is also
	  the default, unless another value has been stored for you. [TVu]
	- In expire-hosts you can use --nomac to expire hosts that don't have a
	  MAC address (previously the script said (with --verbose) that it
	  skipped such hosts, but it really didn't, now it does by default).
	  [TVu]
	- Host history is now updated ny modhosts. User id (uid) and session id
	  (sid) are set to -1. System level login username is recorded in Info
	  field. [TVu]
	- From page Net you have been able to navigate to Net Info, which has
	  now been renamed accordingly. On that page "<-- Back" button has been
	  renamed "Net". Next to that a new button "Show Hosts" has been added,
	  with the same function as on page Net. In host browser, when a cidr is
	  passed as parameter (and shown at top-of-page), two new buttons are
	  shown at the bottom of the page, "Net" and "Net Info". Thus you can
	  easily navigate between all three pages. [TVu]
	- When you have deleted a host using web interface, and the host had an
	  ip address, four navigation buttons are shown: Browse This Subnet, Go
	  to This Subnet, Go to Net Info and Go to Nets/All. Note that if the
	  host had multiple ip addresses, the net referred to by these buttons
	  is based on the address that was selected just before the host was
	  deleted, and that it is the smallest subnet or virtual net found with
	  that address. If the host had no ip address, only Nets/All is shown.
	  [TVu]
	- When you view a host's Network Settings, Network name is shown. VLAN
	  name and number are also shown, if available. [TVu]
	- In "Servers" selection list replaces current server as default item to
	  display. Name of current server is also displayed and it acts as a
	  link. "Zones" has been changed in similar way. Lines in zone list are
	  numbered and a button to produce a CSV list has been added to the
	  bottom of the page. [TVu]
	- About page updated. [TVu]
