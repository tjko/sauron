	 FTP: ftp://ftp.jyu.fi/pub/sauron/


TESTED PLATFORMS

	(if required programs are available).


INSTALLATION 

  See User Guide for complete installation instruction. This section
  is only a quick overview of the installation process:

  1) Build and install the program (SKIP this if you're installing the RPM):
	./configure
	make
	make docs	(optional)
	make install

  2) Create database for Sauron to use in PostgreSQL
     	(use createdb command to create the database, see PostgreSQL
	 documentation for more help)

  3) Edit configuration files: config and config-browser
	(these are usually in /usr/local/etc/sauron or /etc/sauron)
	at minimum you need to check paths and setup database
	connection string (DB_CONNECT)

  4) Create tables in the newly created database:
	<change to installation directory (/usr/local/sauron)>
	./createtables
	./status		(check that everything worked)

  5) Populate OUI (Ethernet card manufacturer) table (optional):
	./import-ethers contrib/Ethernet.txt
	./import-ethers --force contrib/additional-ether-codes.txt
	   (NOTE! you may want to download IEEE's public list
	    of OUIs from: http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/index.shtml
	    and import it as well)

  6) Populate global root servers table:
	./import-roots default contrib/named.root
	  (NOTE! you should download latest version of this file
	   from: ftp://ftp.rs.internic.net/domain/ and use it)

  7) Create administrator account:
	./adduser 		(remember to set superuser flag)

  8) Setup www interface
	You need to make sauron.cgi and browser.cgi available through
	your www server. One way to do this is to make symbolic links
	for sauron.cgi and browser.cgi in your cgi-bin directory.
	Copy images under icons/ directory to sauron/icons/ directory
	under your web server root directory (or just make a symbolic link)

  9) now you can use the web interface to create a server and zones, or
     you can import existing named/dhcpd configurations using
     import/iport-dhcp utilities. Or you can try out the demo database
     that can be found under test/ directory in source tree.
