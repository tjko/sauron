When upgrading Sauron you may also need to update your database (format)
to same level (version) as the new version of Sauron requires.
Here is the current version history for database format:

Sauron version		database version
--------------		----------------
0.5.x			1.0
0.6.x			1.0
0.7.0			1.1
0.7.1			1.2
0.7.2			1.3
0.7.3			1.4
0.8.5			1.7
0.9.0			1.8


GENERAL UPGRADE PROCEDURE

 1) Make backup of your database!
 
 2) Identify which conversion script or scripts (if you're
    not upgrading from the previous version) you need to use.
    Conversion scripts are located in the sql/ directory.
    For example script for converting from 1.0 to 1.1
    would be named as: dbconvert_1.0to1.1.sql

 3) run upgrade scripts: psql sauron -f <filename>
   
 4) vacuum database: psql sauron -c 'VACUUM ANALYZE;'
    (running 'VACUUM FULL' might be good idea, too)
